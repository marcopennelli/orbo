# Orbo Container Manifest for meta-container-deploy
# Use with Yocto-based embedded Linux systems
#
# This manifest defines all Orbo containers for automated deployment.
# Place in your Yocto layer and reference in CONTAINER_MANIFEST variable.
#
# Profiles:
#   - basic: Orbo only (motion detection)
#   - ai: Orbo + YOLO (object detection)
#   - full: Orbo + YOLO + Recognition (face recognition)
